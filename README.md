# About My Boutique Style Practice
I believe in the power of counseling, making a therapeutic connection with my clients inspires them to change their world and improve their quality of life. I love working with individuals, couples, and families. I use a variety of approaches with all of my clients that may include: talk therapy, DBT, cognitive behavioral and art therapy approaches to address a wide range of issues such as relationship problems, depression, anxiety, unexpected life changes. We will work together to find what works best for you.

Because I am committed to providing you a boutique therapy experience I limit the number of clients on my caseload. I want to provide care that is truly crafted for you and your specific needs. 

# About Me CA Licensed MFT #113892 
My specialty is using art therapy with my clients. I love art making because often the effects happen quickly and help people that have struggled with traditional talk therapy in the past. You do not have to participate in art therapy to work with me I utilize a variety of therapy approaches. Approaches may include: Adlerian, CBT, Client Centered, DBT, Family Systems, Harm Reduction, MI, Psychoanalytic, Strengths Based, and Trauma Focused.  

Anxiety management, relationship development, learning communication skills, and relaxation techniques are frequently stressed in sessions to help you build a range of personal resources to build stronger relationships and live a better life. Developing these tools may help you with your current needs for support. Be that you are transitioning through a career change, difficult illness, relationship issues, loss, trauma, or divorce.

Day Treatment program for children with Autism spectrum disorders (ASD)
Community based programs serving adolescents and adults with substance abuse and severe mental health issues

### Teletherapy Services
For some clients it may be appropriate to conduct sessions via videoconfereneing or commonly refered to as teletherapy. I utilize teletherapy with clients when the benefits outway the cons. It removes barriers for those with limited mobility due to physical issues or complex anxiety. It is beneficial for those with limited access to reliable transportation, or schedule constraints that prohibit in office visits.

It is not appropriate for all clients and some do not feel as comfortable online as they do in a cozy office. For example all laws regarding the confidentiality of health care information and a patient's right to their medical information apply to telehealth sessions and every effort wil be made to keep your PHI confidental. The reality is that nothing online is 100% secure. Encrypted software will be utilized. If you are interested in this treatment modality just contact me and we can discuss if it would be appropriate for your situation.
