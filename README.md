You do not have to participate in art therapy to work with me I utilize a variety of therapy approaches. I can offer an income based sliding scale fee, call or email for more info.

I believe in the power of counseling, making a therapeutic connection with my clients inspires them to change their world and improve their quality of life. I love working with individuals, couples, and families. I use a variety of approaches with all of my clients that may include: talk therapy, DBT, cognitive behavioral and art therapy approaches to address a wide range of issues such as relationship problems, depression, anxiety, unexpected life changes. We will work together to find what works best for you.

Anxiety management, relationship development, learning communication skills, and relaxation techniques are frequently stressed in sessions to help you build a range of personal resources to build stronger relationships and live a better life. Developing these tools can help transition through job changes, illness, relationship issues, loss, and divorce.
