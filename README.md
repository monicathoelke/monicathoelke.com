# About Me CA Licensed MFT #113892 
I love being creative and supporting others in the art making process. Often with art therapy the effects happen quickly and may help people that have struggled with traditional talk therapy in the past. Everyone has different needs and you do not have to participate in art therapy to work with me. I utilize an ecclectic approach to therapy that may include: Adlerian, CBT, Client Centered, DBT, Family Systems, Harm Reduction, MI, Psychoanalytic, Strengths Based, and or Solution Focused.  
Anxiety management, relationship development, learning communication skills, and relaxation techniques are frequently stressed in sessions to build you a range of personal resources to build stronger relationships, and live a better life. Developing these tools may help you with your current needs for support. 

## Experience
In addition to a private practice I have provided mental health counseling and art therapy services in a variety of treatment settings including:
In an inpatient substance abuse treatment program for women, young adult women, and their children. 
At a hospital based day treatment program for adolescents with mental health and or substance abuse issues.
At a day treatment program for children with Autism spectrum disorders (ASD).
Through community based programs serving adolescents and adults with substance abuse and severe mental health issues.

### Teletherapy Services
For some clients it may be appropriate to conduct sessions via videoconferencing or commonly refered to as teletherapy. I utilize teletherapy with clients when it is the most clinically apropriate mode of treatment. It can remove treatment barriers for those with limited mobility due to physical issues or complex anxiety. It is often beneficial for those with limited access to reliable transportation, or schedule constraints that prohibit in office visits.

Teletherapy is not appropriate for all clients and some clients do not feel as comfortable online as they do in a cozy office. For example all laws regarding the confidentiality of health care information and a patient's right to their medical information apply to telehealth sessions and every effort wil be made to keep your PHI confidental. The reality is that nothing online is 100% secure encrypted software will be utilized. If you are interested in this treatment modality just contact me and we can discuss if it would be appropriate for your situation.
